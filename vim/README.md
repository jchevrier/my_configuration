#  Vim configuration.
Two configurations are available: standard standalone .vimrc and vim-spf13-based configuration.
To use the first one:
- install npm
- from Vim: run "CocInstall coc-json coc-xml coc-vimlsp coc-python coc-clangd"

In order to use the latter, [vim-spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) must be installed first.
Then copy or do symbolic link to those configuration files in home directory.
Update vim configuration with Vundle commands.
